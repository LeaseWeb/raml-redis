# RAML API Designer Redis Store



## Overview

raml-redis provides a simple storage API which enable you to run [RAML API Designer](https://github.com/mulesoft/api-designer) locally and use Redis as storage of the RAML files/folders.

## Requirements
The service is built with node.js, using express and redis. 

## Optional
To run the server as a daemon you can use foreman (see below).

### Installing Node.js
Go to [nodejs.org](http://nodejs.org), and click the Install button.

### Installing Redis
To install Redis please check the [Redis Website](http://redis.io).
On Ubuntu you can simply run the following command:

`apt-get install redis-server`

### Installing RAML-Redis
From the top-level directory (e.g. raml-redis):

`npm install`

This will install express and redis client for node.js (https://github.com/mranney/node_redis)
    
## Running the Service
From the top-level directory (e.g. raml-redis):

`node server.js`

If you prefer to run the server in the background [forever](http://blog.nodejitsu.com/keep-a-nodejs-server-up-with-forever) is awesome. 

`npm install forever`

`forever start server.js`


## Integration with API-Designer
Follow instructions at [api-designer](https://github.com/mulesoft/api-designer) to install and run API-Designer.  
Currently this is test with version 0.0.1

Copy the file `local-storage-file-system.jsÂ` to your API-DESIGNER subfolder:

`cp local-storage-file-system.js API_DESIGNER_HOME/app/scripts/services`

Change the API_URL in the file to point to the raml-redis URL


## TO DO
- With an empty Redis DB, the give an error on first visit of the API Designer. After that the error will disappear.
